# Kaggle Kernels

My kernels from Kaggle.

## IBM's attrition

A rather classic turnover analysis but with additional element of accounting for class imbalance - quite helpful if metrics need to be improved.

## Clustering with Gower's metric

A useful method for exploring clusters in multi-dimensional data with several data types (`numeric`/`integers` as well as `factors`), feasible on smaller datasets.  

## Kaggle survey with igraph

Exploring some networks of tools and methods used by Kagglers with a little help fom `igraph` and custom `rlang` functions.
